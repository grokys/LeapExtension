# Visual Studio Leaps Client

Spike of a [Leaps](https://github.com/Jeffail/leaps) client for Visual Studio 2015. 

## Trying it out

- Create a directory with a source file in it
- Copy the directory to somewhere else, keeping the same directory name
  Start the Leaps client in the first directory
- Browse to `localhost:8080` and open the source file in leaps
- Run the extension and open the same file in the second directory
- You should now see two cursors and be sharing edits in VS and the browser
